# ToGAF
## Basics
**Architecture** by ToGAF:  
"It is the structure of components, their interrelationships and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time."
So, Architecture is:
* components of the system and their relations between each other
* AND the principles governing their design and evolution over time

**Architecture framework** answers on another question: "How do we do architecture?"
