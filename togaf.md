## Basics
**Architecture** by ToGAF:  
"It is the structure of components, their interrelationships and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time."
So, Architecture is:
* components of the system and their relations between each other
* AND the principles governing their design and evolution over time

**Architecture framework** answers on another question: "How do we do architecture?"  

Abbreviatures:
ADM - Architecture Development Method
Architecture Content - Artifacts, Documents, Lists, and all stuff comes to your repository
Enterprise Architecture Capability & Governance - the ability of an organization to execute its strategy effectively with the help of its architecture
