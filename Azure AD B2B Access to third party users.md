* Useful for Single-tenant application when you need to grant access for users outside of your organization

> Entitlement management uses Azure AD business-to-business (B2B) to share access so you can collaborate with people outside your organization.
> With Azure AD B2B, external users authenticate to their home directory, but have a representation in your directory.
> The representation in your directory enables the user to be assigned access to your resources.
