**Fully based on Architecture Vision you created on the step A**  
Example:  
   - We want to become the most customer friendly organization in our whole industry.
   - We want to become famous for customer service.
   - Whatever your vision is, you've defined that.
Now you need to put more details.  

## Purpose of Business Architecture
1) develop what's called the target business architecture.
   * When you're talking about architecture domains, oftentimes we'll talk about baseline and target.
      - baseline - is the architecture as it exists today, the existing business structures and processes.
      - target - is a dreamed future where you want to be.
      - you might have interim architectures in between the baseline and the target.
2) identify what is called architecture roadmap items (which are based on gaps)
   * it's going to take a number of things to get you from the baseline to the target.
   * And so you're going to those are called your gaps and you're going to basically put onto a roadmap what are the steps

## Inputs to Business Architecture
1) External Reference Materials
   - anything that has been produced by another company, another organization that you are relying on the request for architecture work.
   - which were potentially signed in the preliminary phase.
2) Request for Architecture Work (from Preliminary Phase, optional)
3) Business Principles, Goals, Drivers (from 1st Phase, Architecture Vision phase)
   - In Phase A, you've defined your business principles and goals and drivers
4) Organizational Capability Assessment (from Architecture Vision Phase)

  - classifies contextual assets used to develop architectures, such as policies, standards, strategic initiatives, organizational structures, and enterprise-level capabilities.
  - The Enterprise Continuum can also classify solutions (as opposed to descriptions or specifications of solutions).
11) Architecture Repository (Preliminary Phase)
  - Shared folder with your documents which is available for all stakeholders
12) Architecture Vision (output from Architecture Vision Phase)
13) Draft Architecture Definition Document (on Phase A)
  -  draft architecture document that was done
  -  draft version of all baselines
  -  target BDAT documents
