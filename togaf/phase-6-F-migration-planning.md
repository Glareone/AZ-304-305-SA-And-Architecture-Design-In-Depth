## Purpose (Objective)
* Finalize the Architecture Roadmap
* Finalize Migration Plan (if it's needed in case of transition architectures)
   - make sure that the migration plan does match with the enterprise current approach to change.
   - different organizations handle change differently at different speeds. They need different things in place to get things done.
* Ensure the business value and the cost of work packages is understood
   - If you're you're recommending that the company move their computer systems from the old way of doing business to this new way of doing business, you're going to have to be able to say and this is going to unlock this much in revenue over this many years and is going to cost this much to do the translation and therefore it's worth doing.
 
## Inputs to Phase F
1. External Reference Materials
2. Request for Architecture work (Preliminary Phase)
3. Capability Assessment (Phase A)
4. Communication Plan (Phase A)
5. Organization Model for Enterprise Architecture (Preliminary Phase)
6. Governance Models and Frameworks
7. Tailored Architecture Frameworks
8. Approved statement of Architecture Work (Phase A)
9. Architecture Vision (Phase A)
10. Architecture Repository
11. Draft Architecture Documents and Draft Requirements (BDAT)
12. Change requests for existing business programs and projects
13. Architecture Roadmap, draft version (Phase E Opportunities)
14. Implementation and migration plan, draft (Phase E Opportunities, output of)

## Steps for migration planning
1. Confirm management framework interactions
2. Assign a business value to each work package
   - So in the last phase you identified what the work packages are and now you're going to basically say what is the value that we're unlocking?
   - what is the business outcome?
3. Estimate resource requirements, project timings, etc
4. Prioritize the migration projects via cost and\or benefit assessment, conduct risk validation.
   - Maybe there's some really quick wins, some really easy to do, changes that are going to unlock a lotof business value. You can prioritize those earlier.
5. Confirm architecture roadmap and update Architecture Definition Document
6. Generate Implementation and Migration Plan
   - Now you get the final implementation migration plan.
   - You know who's working on what, which project is being created.
   - The cost benefit analysis.
7. Complete the Architecture Development cycle, lessons learned
   - So did you would you do things differently another time?
   - This could also mean you have to develop your architecture capability.
   - And so you're doing some introspection and say, Do we need additional people?
   - Do we need additional training?
   - Do we need to revise the TOGAF architecture framework a little bit because this didn't quite work?

**Need to clarify how different frameworks in your organization will work together:**  
* "Work with certain frameworks. So business planning frameworks. Enterprise architecture frameworks. The project management frameworks and the operations frameworks. And so if you might have it over here and PMP over here and Agile and all of these different frameworks.  
How does that all going to work?"

## Output of Migration Planning
1. Approved version of Implementation and Migration Plan
   - So you've got your strategy, you've got different projects and portfolios,
   - who's doing what?
   - What's going to end at the end of this project?
   - What's going to happen?
   - What are the milestones, the timing?
   - How that relates to the target architecture?
2. Finalized the Architecture Definition Document
   - your baseline and target
3. Finalized Architecture Requirements
4. Finalized Architecture roadmap
5. Reusable Architecture Building Blocks (architectures which could be reused)
   - You identified Solution Building blocks previously.
   - Now you can go to the abstract and go to the architecture building blocks.
6. Request for Architecture Work for the next ADM cycle (if any)
7. implementation of governance model
   - are going to be able to deliver those things that that provide the value.
   - The costs are in line.
8. Change requests for architecture capability from lessons learned
   - So again, architecture capability,
   - more people,
   - new training,
   - new techniques,
   - new software
