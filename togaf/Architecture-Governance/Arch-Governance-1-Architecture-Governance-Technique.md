# Architecture Governance Technique

## What is
Architecture governance is a system of management and control over the enterprise architecture.  
And as an architecture team or at the enterprise architect, you create an architecture, you're going to want to make sure that the implementation meets and matches what you intended for it to be and an ongoing compliance with the design of the architecture.  
  *  So it's the processes that you put in place
  *  The people that you put in place
  *  How you control the design of the business processes, application data and technology within your organization.

Important to note:
1. Accountability to the business for that
2. Governance is layered within the most of organizations.
   - it's not normal if only a single person or a single group is the governance structure.
   - usually it's a layer of governance layers from the top
     * board of directors is effectively a governance layer. Now, they may not be involved in the day to day running of the operations of the business, but you go down a layer and down a layer and there's going to be layers of governance too, at the top.

## Type of Governance, Layers
1. Corporate Governance (top layer)
   - board of directors.
   - It's also includes the executive team, the CEO and all those positions that start with the letter C.
2. Technology Governance (second layer)
   - a lot of what we do in business has to do with applications and technology. And so the CTO is often a very powerful position.
3. IT Governance (third layer)
   - Systems
   - System Implementers
     * they need to have change controls and ticketing systems and documentation for changes.
4. Architecture Governance (third layer as well)

**So each of these are considered domains and they may exist at in different geographies.**

## TOGAF Principles of Good Governance
* Discipline
  - discipline is basically that all involved parties will adhere to these agreed upon procedures and processes and will respect the decisions of the authority maker.
  - if you go and make a change request and you go to the Architecture Governance Board and you make a request and they deny your request, you don't just go and go against their wishes?
* Transparency
  - So good governance will have this transparency where if somebody is making a request that's public, the decision is also public and anyone can go and inspect that.
  - They're not secret decisions.
* Independence
  - so all processes, all decisions, the whole thing is going to be avoid or minimize conflicts of interest.
  - So independence of the governance board is is paramount.
* Accountability
  - people who make decisions and take actions are then authorized to do so, but also accountable to their decisions.
* Responsibility
  - all people who are involved in this process require to act responsibly to the organization and to the individual stakeholders.
* Fairness
  - all decisions taken and all of that processes will not be allowed to create an unfair advantage to anyone.
