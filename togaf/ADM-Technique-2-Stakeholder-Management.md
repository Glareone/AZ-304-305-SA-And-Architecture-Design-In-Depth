# Stakeholder Management
* Stakeholder - is any individual team organization or some way to classify people that has an interest in a system.
* As an architect, you will be able to win support for your plans by basically doing a really great presentation to the stakeholders and explaining to them how your plans help them.
1. First point is to know who are the powerful stakeholders, who you have to keep happy
   - it doesn't mean the person who's doing the work is less important in the overall scheme.
   - But the people that you have to make happy are the people who are the ones that are decision makers.
   - So having good stakeholder management does make things easier for you as you get your documents signed off and you get the budgets to do the work.
2. Establishing a communication plan to know how often to communicate with these people, what level of detail to give them.
   - And it's also being able to read the room, understand what the problems are.
   - Found the conflicts earlier in order to be able to navigate those and not be tricked.
   - Power of individuals and the level of their interest (high interest means the level of decision making) in your project:
