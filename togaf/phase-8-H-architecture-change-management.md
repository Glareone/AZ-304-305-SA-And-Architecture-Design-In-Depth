## Objective (Purpose)
1. Maintain the Architecture Lifecycle  
   * you're just going to be monitoring the implementation, making sure the implementation is working according to the plan.  
   * you're monitoring that you are achieving the key deliverables and the business value that you are hoping to unlock  

2. Execute Governance over your Architecture  
   * making sure that your solutions maintain compliance to your architecture designs
3. Maintain Architecture Capability
   * You don't want your architecture capability, which is yourself and your team, to lose their skills or get get dispersed or whatever.
   * You maintain or improve your architecture capability.
  
## Inputs
1. External Reference Materials

6. Architecture Vision (Phase A)
7. Architecture Repository (all documents in it)

## Steps
So in Phase H, everything's been deployed and now you have what's called value realization.  
So you did an analysis several steps ago, phases ago, where you said this is the value of each work product.  
If we spend this money and do this work where should be able to reduce costs by this much or increase revenue by this much?  
And so now you just have to make sure that now that you've done the work, that the value is realized.  

1. Establish Value Realization Process
2. Deploy Monitoring Tools
3. Manage Risks
4. Provide Analysis for Architecture Change Management
5. Develop Change Requirements to Meet Performance Target
6. Manage Governance Process
7. Activate the process to Implmenet Change
