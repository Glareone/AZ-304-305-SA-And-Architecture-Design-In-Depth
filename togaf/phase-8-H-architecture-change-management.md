![image](https://github.com/Glareone/AZ-304-305-SA-And-Architecture-Design-In-Depth/assets/4239376/fc7c4335-dc66-4adc-b65b-c9fc37059a20)

## Objective (Purpose)
1. Maintain the Architecture Lifecycle  
   * you're just going to be monitoring the implementation, making sure the implementation is working according to the plan.  
   * you're monitoring that you are achieving the key deliverables and the business value that you are hoping to unlock  

2. Execute Governance over your Architecture  
   * making sure that your solutions maintain compliance to your architecture designs
3. Maintain Architecture Capability
   * You don't want your architecture capability, which is yourself and your team, to lose their skills or get get dispersed or whatever.
   * You maintain or improve your architecture capability.
  
## Inputs
1. External Reference Materials
2. Request Architecture Work (optional) (Preliminary Phase)
3. Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture (Preliminary Phase)
4. Tailored Architecture Framework (Preliminary Phase) - how your selected Architecture Framework matches with what your organization is using
5. Statement of Architecture Work (Phase A)
6. Architecture Vision (Phase A)
7. Architecture Repository (all documents in it)
8. Architecture Definition Documents and Requirements (BDAT)
9. Architecture Roadmap (F)
10. Change Request - technology change, business changes, lessons learned
11. Implementation Governance Model
12. Architecture Contract (G)
13. Compliance Assessment (G)
14. Implementation and migration plan, approved version (F)

## Steps
So in Phase H, everything's been deployed and now you have what's called value realization.  
So you did an analysis several steps ago, phases ago, where you said this is the value of each work product.  
If we spend this money and do this work where should be able to reduce costs by this much or increase revenue by this much?  
And so now you just have to make sure that now that you've done the work, that the value is realized.  

1. Establish Value Realization Process
2. Deploy Monitoring Tools
3. Manage Risks - plan based on monitoring tools how to manage different situations and find new opportunities
4. Provide Analysis for Architecture Change Management
   - So if someone comes and says, okay, we need to add a new piece of third party software, this is something that's come up. How does that fit into your architecture and architecture change management?
5. Develop Change Requirements to Meet Performance Target
   - Now, if your architecture is not meeting its performance targets, so let's say you did the work and it's just not quite living up to expectations, then you might then end up having to make some change requirements. So it may be that, Oh, you know what, we underestimated this or we overestimated this and we do have to do a couple more pieces of work to realize that value.
6. Manage Governance Process
7. Activate the process to Implmenet Change

## Output
May last very short. But at some point that's done and you are ready to start a new ADM cycle.
1. Architecture updates (maintenance)
2. Change to Architecture Framework and principles (maintenance)
3. New Request for Architecture Work (for major changes)
4. Statement of Architecture Work (update if necessary)
5. Architecture Contract (update if necessary)
6. Compliance Assessment (update if necessary)

## Artifacts
None
