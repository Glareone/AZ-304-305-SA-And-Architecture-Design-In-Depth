## Objective (Purpose)
Technically it's a phase, but it's not something that has a specific start and end.  
It's just a constant technique that we're going to use to handle change.  
So requirements management is a process of handling this change.   
  * continuous process of handling change during any phase of the ADM process.
  * The ability to handle change through all the phases is one of the purposes.
  * Another purpose is to manage the change.
  * Provide the requirements to each ADM phase
