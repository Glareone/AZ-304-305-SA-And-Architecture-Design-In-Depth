**Phase A, which is the architecture vision phase that is about your vision, that is about your goals, thinking in the future where you like the business to go.**  
**Phase B was the business architecture phase, and that is the things that you need to actually do to get your business from A to B.**  
**Fully based on Architecture Vision you created on the step A**    
Example:   
   - We want to become the most customer friendly organization in our whole industry.
   - We want to become famous for customer service.
   - Whatever your vision is, you've defined that.
Now you need to put more details.

**Generally you should realize that Phase B is the business requirements phase.**  
   - And so you're going to have to at some point defined the business requirements.  

## Purpose of Business Architecture
1) develop what's called the target business architecture.
   * When you're talking about architecture domains, oftentimes we'll talk about baseline and target.
      - baseline - is the architecture as it exists today, the existing business structures and processes.
      - target - is a dreamed future where you want to be.
      - you might have interim architectures in between the baseline and the target.
2) identify what is called architecture roadmap items (which are based on gaps)
   * it's going to take a number of things to get you from the baseline to the target.
   * And so you're going to those are called your gaps and you're going to basically put onto a roadmap what are the steps

## Inputs to Business Architecture
1) External Reference Materials
   - anything that has been produced by another company, another organization that you are relying on the request for architecture work.
   - which were potentially signed in the preliminary phase.
2) Request for Architecture Work (from Preliminary Phase, optional)
3) Business Principles, Goals, Drivers (from 1st Phase, Architecture Vision phase)
   - In Phase A, you've defined your business principles and goals and drivers
4) Organizational Capability Assessment (from Architecture Vision Phase)
5) Communication Plan (from Architecture Vision Phase)
   - With different stakeholders you need to interact differently, with different level of details, more or less often, confirm something or not
6) Organizational Model of Enterprise Architecture
   - All stakeholders, contacts, departments you need to interact with within your organization
7) Tailored Architecture Framework (from Preliminary Phase)
   - What architecture framework your enterprise is using, what you gonna use, how they meet each other, etc.
   - Your TOGAF version that you are that you've customized and you're working with the approved statement of architecture work.
8) Approved your Statement of Architecture Work (Phase Architecture Vision)
9) Architecture Principles (Preliminary Phase)
    - your principles you rarely change.
       * decision to go with Azure,
       * or stick with set of Languages,
       * with technologies, build them on your own or buy and incorporate them
10) Enterprise Continuum
  - classifies contextual assets used to develop architectures, such as policies, standards, strategic initiatives, organizational structures, and enterprise-level capabilities.
  - The Enterprise Continuum can also classify solutions (as opposed to descriptions or specifications of solutions).
11) Architecture Repository (Preliminary Phase)
  - Shared folder with your documents which is available for all stakeholders
12) Architecture Vision (output from Architecture Vision Phase)
13) Draft Architecture Definition Document (on Phase A)
  -  draft architecture document that was done
  -  draft version of all baselines
  -  target BDAT documents

## Steps of Business Architecture
1) Select Reference models, viewpoints, and tools
   - So you're looking at the amount of external reference materials you have available and choosing relevant ones that can help you.
2) Develop baseline Business Architecture Description
   - So how your business is designed today
3) Develop target Business Architecture Description
   - your target business architecture, how your business is going to be designed.
4) Perform Gap Analysis
   - what's the differences between the baseline and the target?
   - Maybe there's large parts of your business that don't have to change The baseline and the target are the same.
   - And so that means you don't have gaps in that area.
   - But if you have parts of the business that do have to change, you have to identify those, pull that into a separate document.
5) Define Candidate Roadmap Components
   - Answers on how you gonna cover all gaps you found
   - So if you're going to have to change your process of defining the process, or modifying the process
       * all of the things that go along with that, go on to your roadmap
6) Resolve Impacts across the architecture landscape
   - Impacts are the conflicts between between what you are desiring to improve:
       * Improve the quality of the service
       * Cost of the product
       * Cost of the ownershipping
       * How are you going to add more staff members to the customer service department but also meet the overall?
       * Reduce expenses
   - You need to identify where the conflicts between your ideas
   - Come to an agreement how you are going to resolve them
7) Conduct formal stakeholder review
   - Is about how you gonna changing the business processes, not about technologies or application stuff yet.
   - present what you found to your stakeholders
   - formal stakeholders review
   - submit the list of issues or what stakeholders would like to see
   - what conflicts you found and how you gonna mitigate them
8) Finalize Business Architecture
   - put everything you get on previous stages, and finalize them. After that you may start creating Architecture Definition Document
9) Create Architecture Definition Document
    - This is the foundation for what you're going to do for the rest of this project for the next several months or years is once you've defined that, how you're changing the business.
    - Everything else needs to fall in line to assist with that

## Outputs of Business Architecture
1) Refine your Architecture Vision (A) Deliverables
   - So if you've had to change any of your Phase A's, so if your vision had to be tweaked or if your any of your goals or drivers or things like that needed additional refinement, that obviously gets updated.
2) Draft version of Architecture Definition Document
   - approved baseline Business Architecture
   - approved target Business Architecture
   - the target business architecture up to a final version 1.0.
3) Draft version of Architecture Requirements Specification. Gap Analysis
   - what the gap between the baseline and target, how we gonna mitigate, how to achieve target goals
4) Business Architecture Components of Architecture Roadmap
   - we've now filled in the business components, not necessarily the others.
