# ADM Technique. Interoperability Requirements
## Two types: Data Interoperability and Technical Interoperability.

## Meaning
Ability to share information and services.  
Explains how business teams are working together.  
going down into the information level, it's how data is shared information, interoperability.  

## Objective (Goal)
1. Data Interoperability: So if you have your customer database over here, how does this team over there get access to it?
2. Data Interoperability: How are business teams intercommunicating?
3. Technical interoperability: which is how technical things are connected to one another. Sometimes systems are just so completely independent that there's just no way to connect A with B without some kind of middleman in between.
4. Can it be done? Should it be done? How important is it?

## What to do
* So as you're going through again, phases B and C and D, there is some thought being given to interoperability.
* So there's elements, like I said, of business data and application and technology that you have to consider.
