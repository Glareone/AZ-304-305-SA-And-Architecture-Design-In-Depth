## Purpose. Basics
1) The purpose is to have a high level vision, including any emerging technologies that are impacting your industry.
   - So if you know that AI is the next big thing and you have to understand how is your company going to incorporate AI, how is it going to respond to AI or whatever is happening in the world? This gets included in your vision and it's very high level.
2) It is a rough description or design of what the end state of your architecture is going to be.
   - If in the end you're going to have to break up your main product into several smaller projects, make it modular and have customers be able to add additional add ons
3) You're going to have a rough idea of this is the end state of your of your company's.
   
companies develop add ons for it.
## Objectives
1) Build high-level vision of business value to be delivered
   - So, you consider your organization's aspirations. What abilities or qualities does it seek to acquire or develop?
2) Obtain an approval of the "Statement of Architecture Work"

## Inputs of Architecture Vision
1) Architecture Reference Materials
   - Architecture Materials which are external to your enterprise - are referenced Architecture materials.
   - They must be available to you
2) Request for Architecture Work
   - In Preliminary phase it was optional, but before starting your work someone should formally on paper request to start this work
3) Business Principles, Goals, Business Drivers
   - From Preliminary Phase
4) Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture
   - Correct organization, roles, and responsibilities within the enterprise. 
5) Tailored Architecture Framework
   - This tailoring will include integration with project and process management frameworks, customization of terminology, development of presentational styles, selection, configuration, and deployment of architecture tools, etc.
6) Populated Architecture Repository
   - Documents you initialized in Architecture Repository

## Steps to Perform Architecture Vision Phase
1) Establish your Architecture Project
   - your kickoff session with your team. "Hey guys, we are over the next few months going to do the following. Here's our timeline, here's our budget. This is what we're going to do."  
2) Identifying who is your key stakeholders, concerns and business requirements
   - who is the actual stakeholder, which has a business interest in the output
   - who are just people who are concerned and what are their concerns  
3) Confirm business goals
   - what are the business requirements coming from the stakeholders confirming that the goals, drivers and constraints are still valid.
4) Evaluating Organizational Capabilities
   - This is different than evaluating your architecture capabilities.
   - This is looking to see what is it that your company does well, What doesn't it do well?
   - Where do we rank among our competitors, among the industry, among customer expectations?
   - How great our competitors in what we are trying to do?
5) Assess Readiness for transformations
   - TOGAF Business Readiness, The Transformation Risks and the Readiness for Transformation:
       * some companies are remarkably agile and flexible when it comes to handling change, and some businesses are not as as comfortable handling change.
       * estimate resistance and readiness for transformations.
6) Define the Scope
   - Understand the scope of the project:
       * Are you trying to define the enterprise architecture for the full enterprise?
       * Are you focused in this particular iteration of the cycle on only a specific component of that?
7) Confirm Architecture Principles, including business principles
   - confirm that the architecture principles that were defined in the preliminary phase are still valid and including the business principles.
8) Develop Architecture Vision
   - Bring everything together
   - You're coming together with an architecture to help the business meets the expected future:
       * cheaper product
       * better quality of products
       * be more flexible
       * be more responsive to client needs
   - Then you're going to have to develop a business case around that:
       * if you meet your architecture vision, then what kind of value are you unlocking?
9) Define the target architecture value and KPI
   - Key Performance Indicator and so that's how you're going to measure this.
10) Identify Risks of Transformation
   -  Maybe competition changes, maybe your product isn't well received.
   -  There's a lot of risks and what are the mitigations you can put against that?
11) Develop Statement of Architecture Work, secure approval
   - at the end of your when you've got your vision, your value and KPIs, identified the risks and the mitigations for that
   - you put that all together and then you have to sell it to your stakeholders, your CEO, your heads of each of the departments
      * Do you guys agree we start doing this and this and this, do you agree?
   - You still have to define the requirements and still have to come up with a plan.

## Outputs of Architecture Vision
1) Approved Statement of Architecture Work
   - So that document with the signatures on it
2) Refined Statement of business principles, goals, and drivers
3) Architecture Principles
4) Organizational Capability Assessment
   - Any kind of assessment that you made of the capabilities of your organization
5) Tailored Architecture Framework
6) Architecture Vision
   - you certainly must understand how your business operatestoday.
   - You know what it's doing, how it does it, what kind of changes need to be made in those departments?
7) Draft Architecture Definition Document (may include baseline and target BDAT documents)
   - have a rough idea of that and so you can create a rough document outlining the kinds of changes that need to be made.
   - (!!!!) these get refined in phases B, C and D.
8) Communications Plan
   - how often you communicate with who.
   - certain stakeholders at different levels are going to need different levels of communication.
9) Additional Content in the Architecture Repository
   - And any additional content that got generated or you came across that goes into the architecture repository.

## Artifacts Produced
### You can look at the architecture content in TOGAF standard to see examples of this or blank versions of this maps and diagrams
1) Matrices: Stakeholders Map Matrix
2) Diagrams:
   - Business Model Diagram
   - Business Capability Map
   - Value stream Map
   - Value chain Diagram
   - Solution Concept Diagram
