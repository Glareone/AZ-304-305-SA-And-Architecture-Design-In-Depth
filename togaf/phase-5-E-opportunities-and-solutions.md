## Purpose (Objectives)
1) generate the Initial Architecture Roadmap
2) Identify if Transition Architectures are required
   - Now maybe you can get from where you are to where you want to go with a single project, with some single deployment
   - Or maybe you need what are called transition architectures that will get you partway there and then you can do one or more transition architectures before finally getting to the architecture.
3) Define Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)
   - reusable components
   - identify things in our architecture that can be generalized and reused in other places?

## Inputs
1) External Reference Materials
2) Product Information
3) Request for Architecture Work (Preliminary Phase)
4) Organization Capability Assessment (from Phase A)
5) Communication Plan (from Phase A)
6) Planning Methodologies
7) Organization Model for Enterprise Architecture (from Preliminary Phase)
8) Governance models and frameworks
   - governance models has to do with corporate business planning, your frameworks for these types of things
   - any kind of project management framework
   - are you following the Agile methodology or following some other type of known methods?
9) Tailored Architecture Framework (Preliminary Phase)
10) Approved Statement of Architecture Work (from Phase A)
11) Architecture Vision (from Phase A)
12) Architecture Repository (from Preliminary Phase)
13) Draft Architecture Documents and draft Requirements (BDAT)
14) Change requests for existing business programs and projects
    - ormal requests for modifications or enhancements in current business programs or projects.
    - These could span from minor adjustments to major upgrades or feature implementations.
    - Such change requests are typically fueled by evolving business needs, emerging technologies, user feedback or a change in organizational strategy.
    - The purpose is to ensure that the existing projects or programs continue to align with the organization's goals and continue to meet, or ideally exceed, user needs and expectations.
15) Candidate Architecture Roadmap Components
    - Components you get analyzed your gaps

## Steps
So we're no longer defining our business architectures or our architectures we are now planning.

1) Determine key corporate change attributes
2) Determine business constraints for implementation
   - So what are what is coming up that is going to constrain you?
   - "extremely busy holiday season, which is in the United States is November and December, therefore in October is a cut off for doing deployments."
   - And so understanding what your business constraints are that are around implementation
3) Review and consolidate gap analysis for Phase B to D
   - review your gap analysis from phases B, C and D and you consolidate them.
4) Review consolidated requirements across business functions
   - review your requirements that you've been coming together, consolidate them
5) Consolidate and reconcile interoperability requirements
   - if you've got existing implementations, existing contracts, you've got what kind of coordination you need to do between departments.
6) Refine and Validate Dependencies
   - Maybe there is projects that are underway that are going to be impacted.
   - So understanding various dependencies.
