## Purpose (Objectives)
1) generate the Initial Architecture Roadmap
2) Identify if Transition Architectures are required
   - Now maybe you can get from where you are to where you want to go with a single project, with some single deployment
   - Or maybe you need what are called transition architectures that will get you partway there and then you can do one or more transition architectures before finally getting to the architecture.
3) Define Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)
   - reusable components
   -  identify things in our architecture that can be generalized and reused in other places?
