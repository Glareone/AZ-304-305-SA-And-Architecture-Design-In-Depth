# Gap Analysis
Gap analysis - basically the highlight between the baseline architecture and the target architecture.  
You need to conduct Gap Analysis on each step from B to F, even on Migration planning you need to figure out what gaps your architecture plan has moving from basic architecture towards target architecture.
* the baseline architecture - is the architecture as it currently exists.
* the target architecture is your desired destination.
* the points between anything that is baseline and target is called a gap, and it could be things that are been added.
    - It could be things that have just changed or intentionally omitted.
    - if something's been accidentally omitted, that's also going to be done during the gap analysis.
* It should be easy to explain why something was removed or added.
 
Example: if you identify that the target architecture does not include the following process and you're like,  
Oh, well, that process will still exist and it's not really a gap, then it's going to make you revise your target.
