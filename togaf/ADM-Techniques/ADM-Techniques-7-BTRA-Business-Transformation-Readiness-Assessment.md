# Business Transformation Readiness Assessment
Understanding how to get your organization to accept changes is one of the keys to the success of the whole project.

## Objectives (Goals)
1. the evaluation and quantification of the organization's readiness to undergo change.
2. Managing the situations when you receive significant pushback from individuals or whole teams.
3. What if team members do not see the full picture.

**As an architect, you're going to have to come up with a plan in order to deploy your implementations in a way that your organization is most ready to accept it.**

## What to do
in Preliminary phase you need to evaluate the company transformation readiness:
1. How easy it is to get people to accept that?
2. There's a reason for the change and you need to change and everyone's on board?

## How to do
1. **Determine what those readiness factors that we're going to impact the organization**
  - to workshop something with individuals from different parts of the organization
  - You're going to ask people's opinions and what are the issues?
  - If we were to replace this department with an outsourced company, a third party company, what are the pushbacks we're going to receive?
  - Evaluate if people are going to want to see change or they're going to say, OR their things are perfect and they don't see why you have to change this
     * You need to bring Vision
     * You need to evaluate Desire, Willingness, Resolve
     * You need to understand Need
     * You need to get Business Case
     * You need to get Funding
     * You need to find Leadership, Sponsor, Champions
     * Check Governance
     * Check Factor: Accountability for changes
     * Check Factor: IT Capacity to Execute
     * Check Factor: Enterprise Capacity to Execute

Might be people don't have the understanding of the overall vision of the business.  
And so there's some basic management communication that needs to happen to know what the drivers of the business are, what's the scope of the project.

2. **Present the readiness factors using Maturity Model**
  - we were talking about architectural maturity, and that's just your capability to do architecture.
  - But different parts of your organization have different maturities.
  - Maybe there's an IT maturity that we need to evaluate.
  - Determine the baseline Maturity
  - Determine the target Maturity
    * So what do we need to do to get to this team or this business section up to the speed where we need them to be?
    * How can we shortcut that

3. **Assess the readiness factors, including readiness factor rating**
   - Another workshop, multidisciplinary workshop
   - You're going to use these maturity models and you're going to have to basically determine how ready people are for these change
   - You're going to rank them on certain criteria
    * How urgent is it?
    * What?
    * How difficult is it?
    * What are the risks?

4. Assessing risks for each readiness factor and how can you mitigate that risk?
   - Probably another workshop where you are going to discuss this.
5. Work these actions into Phase E (opportunities and solutions) and Phase F (implementation & migrations plans)
   -  in phases E and F, as you're coming out with breaking up architectures into transition architectures.
   - breaking up roadmap into work packages
   - that's going to be based on your business, business, readiness to accept change.
