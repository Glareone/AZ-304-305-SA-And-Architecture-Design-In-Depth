# Architecture Patterns
1. Pattern - is some idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably be useful in some others. (M.Fowler)  

Example: if you are going to create a call center, you need phone lines, you need people, other parts of call center.  
- That pattern probably already exists.
- And your job is to go out and find the best practices for how other organizations have implemented call centers.

2. TOGAF we've been talking about so far has these concepts of building blocks, both architectural building blocks (ABB),and solution building blocks (SBB). So those are patterns effectively as well.
- So you already have the building blocks in your toy chest.
- And the question is when are you going to pull them out and use them in your architecture designs?

3. TOGAF standard admits that architecture patterns exist, but they have not been integrated into the TOGAF standard in a big way.
- So when you look at the ADM parts, the phases B, C and D, when you're defining the architecture, we're not really talking about grabbing patterns.
- That's not really part of any of the existing steps.
- But the truth of the matter is that it's up to you to realize that this is a good time to borrow patterns from other places and not reinvent the wheel.
- If you have developed your own abs and so then you've got these patterns that are yours at your disposal, then maybe this is there are rules around when is a good time to use this?
