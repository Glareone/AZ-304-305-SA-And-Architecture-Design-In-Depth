# Architecture Board
the architecture board is the group of people that oversee the implementation of that strategy.  
the architecture board should be representative of all the key stakeholders in the architecture.  
  * So it's not just the architecture group.
  * Not everyone on there are enterprise architects.
  * It's basically a cross section of decision makers, usually at a senior enough level. So these are executive level positions.
  * So they do have the responsibility for all of the decision making when it comes to the architecture.
  * This is part of the architecture requirements and the architecture documents being developed. The approvals come.

## How to use
* If the implementation in Phase G does not comply with the architecture, they get decisions around that.
* Architecture Board memebers want the architecture to have a number of reuse, if they need SBS or ABS as part of it, they're going to be the enforcement of architecture compliance.
* They also have to keep up the architecture capability. So that is responsibility for the maturity level of the architecture discipline.
* architectural board doesn't start and stop. Once you've established it, you just keep that going.
  - You need a sponsor to keep that going.
