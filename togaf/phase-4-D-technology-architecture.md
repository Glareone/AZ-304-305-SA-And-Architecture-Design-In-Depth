# Technology Architecture
<img width="361" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Glareone/AZ-304-305-SA-And-Architecture-Design-In-Depth/assets/4239376/d0166172-d5d8-4996-a136-a9b7328ad593">

## Idea
One of the things you can look for as part of this phase is what is coming up in terms of emerging technologies.  
Maybe there is a guess.  
We're past the mobile era, but a lot of people went from working on their desktops to working on laptops from laptops to what, iPads or their phone.  
And so technology can enable new opportunities.  

## Purpose (Objectives)
1) Develop Target Technology Architecture:  
  - You outlined a vision in the A phase.
  - You have defined your business goals in terms of Phase B,
  - your business architecture,
  - the data and applications required to get you there.
So what is the technology that needs to be aligned with this data and application that's aligned with your business goals?
2) Identify Candidate Architecture Roadmap items based on gaps

## Inputs to Technology Architecture
1) External Reference Materials
2) Product Information on Candidate Product
3) Request for Architecture Work (optional,from Preliminary phase)
4) Organization Capability Assessment (Phase A, same in B)
5) Communication Plan (Phase A, same in B)
6) Organization Model for Enterprise Architecture (Preliminary Phase, same in B)
7) Tailored Architecture Framework (Preliminary Phase, same in B)
   - customized to suit the specific needs, culture, and maturity of an organization.
8) Technology Principles (The TOGAF Standard: ADM Techniques)
9) Approved Statement of Architecture Work (Phase A)
10) Architecture Vision (Phase A)
11) Architecture Repository (Preliminary Phase)
12) Draft Architecture Documents and Draft Requirements (came from Phase B and C)
13) Business, Data, and Application components of an Architecture Roadmap (came from Phase B and Phase C)

## Steps
1) Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools
2) Develop Baseline Technology Architecture Description
3) Develop Target Technology Architecture Description
4) Perform Gap Analysis
5) Define Candidate Roadmap Components
   - Infrastructure Improvements: Introducing more powerful servers, revising network architecture for better performance, or moving towards cloud-based services.
   - Platform changes: Transitioning from one operating system to another, or from one DBMS to another, or introducing container technology like Docker or Kubernetes for application isolation.
   - Security Enhancements: Implementation of additional firewalls, introducing new identity and access management systems, or enhancing encryption methods.
   - Adoption/Upgrade of Software Tools: For example, adoption of a newer version of an existing software, or transitioning towards a more robust software tool that better meets the needs of the organization.
   - Governance and Standards: Implementing new IT governance frameworks or enforcing technology standards across the company.
   - New Technologies: Introducing new technologies like AI or Blockchain based on the identified opportunities and solutions.
6) Resolve impacts across the architecture landscape
7) Conduct Formal Stakeholder Review
  - you can review that design with your formal stakeholders,
  - get their sign off on that,
  - get their feedback.
8) Finalize Technology Architecture
9) Create Architecture Definition Document

## Outputs
1) Refined Phase A Deliverables
2) Draft Architecture Definition Document
   - Baseline Technology Architecture, approved version
   - Target Technology Architecture, approved version
3) Draft Architecture Requirements Specification - gap analysis
4) Technology Architecture Components of an Architecture Roadmap
