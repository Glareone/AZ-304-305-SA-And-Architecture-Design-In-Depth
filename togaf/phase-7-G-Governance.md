## Purpose (Objective)
* Name implies in implementation, governance is really you are governing or monitoring the implementation that is being done by others.
* The purpose of Phase G is to ensure that the implementation of the changes are conforming to your design of those implementations.
* Perform Architecture Governance - check that the applied changes affect the business outcomes

## Inputs for Phase G Implementation Governance
1. External reference materials
2. Request for Architecture Work (Preliminary)
3. Capability Assessment (Phase A)
4. Organizational Model (Prelim)
5. Tailored Architecture Frameworks (Prelim Phase)
   - What other frameworks your organization is using and how TOGAF is working with them?
6. Approved Statement of Architecture Work (Phase A)
7. Architecture Vision (Phase A)
8. Architecture Repository
9. Architecture Definition Documents and requirements (BDAT)
10. Approved version of Architecture Roadmap
11. Implmenentation Governance model
12. Architecture Contract
    - the agreement between you as the architect and the implementation teams and in terms of their work.
    - If you have already changes that need to be implemented for the next cycle, that is also an input as well as the approved implementation of migration plan.
13. Request for Architecture work on next ADM cycle (Phase F)
14. Implementation and Migration Plans (Phase F)

## Steps for Phase G
1. Confirm Scope and priorities for Deployment.
   - So we already laid out a architecture roadmap and then a migration plan.
   - Any particular transition architectures?
2. Identify Deployment resources and Skills
   - Make sure that we have the resources and skills required to do this deployment.
3. Guide Development of Solution Deployment
   - You're going to act as a guide or someone that you can help in terms of the development team,
   - you're obviously not doing the development, but having these ideas of what's important and why they're doing something can actually help.
4. Perform Enterprise Architecture Compliance Review
   - You're going to do compliance reviews. So if there is a solution that's developed or acquired, it could be off the shelf third party software,
   - making sure that that solution complies with your architecture requirements.
5.  Implement Business and IT operations
   - Obviously you've got other teams that are involved besides the development teams
6. Perform Post-Implementation Review and Close the implementation
   - any changes that need to come are obviously going to be part of a new a new cycle

## Output of Phase G
1. Architecture Contract
   - So this is the a joint agreement between development partners and sponsors, which are your business partners on the deliverables, quality and fitness for purpose of an architecture.
2. Compliance Assessment
   - You're also going to assess any compliance and so that compliance assessments become part of your outputs if there are change requests.
3. Change Request
   - So let's say the development team starts to go down a path and then they find that there's an easier solution.
   - So they already planned to go out and purchase the third party software and do this API.
4. Architecture-Compliant solution deployed
   - So they've developed and deployed these solutions and your business is now on a new path, right?
