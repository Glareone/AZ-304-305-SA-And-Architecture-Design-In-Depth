Architecture Repository consist of several parts which are here for different purposes.

1) Architecture Landscape: Architecture Building blocks within the enterprice which could be reused
2) Reference Library: Reference Architectures and their ABB (building blocks) coming from 3rd party resources on which we can have only reference. They may live on different levels - Foundation architectures, Common, Industry, Organization-Specific (enterprises similar to ours)
3) Governance Log: Architecture Decision Log (our decisions, what and why we have done), Compliance assessment (Runs and results)
4) Standard Information Base: a repository area to hold a set of specifications, to which architectures must conform.



### Standards Information Base
The Standards Information Base provides a repository area to hold a set of specifications, to which architectures must conform.  
Establishment of a Standards Information Base provides an unambiguous basis for architectural governance because: The standards are easily accessible to projects and therefore the obligations of the project can be understood and planned for Standards are stated in a clear and unambiguous manner, so that compliance can be objectively assessed.
