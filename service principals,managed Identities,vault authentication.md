## Managed Identities
* A common challenge for developers is the management of secrets and credentials used to secure communication between different components making up a solution.

to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication.
* Azure managed identity is a feature of Azure AD and free of charge.
